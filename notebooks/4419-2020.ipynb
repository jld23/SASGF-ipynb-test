    "If you are copying and pasting code over and over to perform the same operation on multiple variables in a SAS® data step you need to learn about arrays and DO\n",
    "loops. Arrays and DO loops are efficient and powerful data manipulation tools that you should have in your programmer’s tool box. Arrays list the variables that you want to perform the same operation on and can be specified with or without the number of elements/variables in the array. DO loops are used to specify the operation across the elements in the array. This workshop will show you how to create an array and utilize DO loops to perform operations on the elements in an array, create new variables, and change a short wide to a long and skinny data structure.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation can take up the majority of the time dedicated to a statistical analysis for a consulting project. Rather than making sure statistical assumptions are correct, running the procedures to actually analyze the data, and examining the results, much of the time on a project is spent preparing the data for analysis. Often, when preparing a data set for analysis the raw data needs to be manipulated in some way; for example, new variables need to be created, specific questionnaire items need to be reversed, and/or scores need to be calculated. The list can go on and on. What makes the task of preparing a data set for analysis tedious is that many times the same operation needs to be performed on a long list of variables (e.g. questionnaire items). For a beginning SAS® programmer, the most likely approach taken to writing the necessary SAS code is to copy and paste the same code over and over for each variable and then change the variable name. For example, if there is a 100-item questionnaire and 10 items need to be reversed, the code to reverse these 10 items results in a minimum of 10 lines of code, one line for each questionnaire item to reverse. And if there are more items that need manipulation, copying, pasting, and changing variable names becomes a time sink for the programmer/analyst and results in a less efficient program. One way to overcome the inefficient use of time, manpower, and computer processing is to use SAS ARRAYs and DO loops.\n",
